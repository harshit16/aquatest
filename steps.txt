Please perform following steps before executing tests:

Note:
it is advisable to execute this test in pycharm professional or in a environemnt which supports behave BDD
I have attempted  to write test in behave. but due to some config issue these are not working.
however "todolist_mock_server\testCases" contains my approach in behave BDD.


prerequisite:
install pycharm

pip install requests
pip install jsonpath
#for reporting purpose I am using pytest-html
pip install pytest-html

To execute these tests in command prompt navigate to
 "todolist_mock_server\testCases"
 type "pytest --html=report.html"

it will create a report "report.html" and also print result on console.

if you only want to see the result not the report
type pytest test_apiRequest.py -v

option [-v] is verbose which is used for detailed description about test cases execution
